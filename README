I lately needed to create a slideshow that is swipable on tablets.
Therefore I created a jQuery plugin which detects touch events on a div, and scrolls a container with 'items' (the child elements) according to the swipe. The user can swipe through all of the items.
This jQuery plugin can be used to create a swipable slideshow. This package contains an example of a working slideshow.
You can get the jquery plugin from the example. The code is fairly simple, and documented, so an API is not necessary.
In this example, the slideshow normally runs every 5 seconds, but is also swipable (if the touch events are supported).
Because vertical scrolling on the iPad causes the horizontal swipe scrolling to be delayed, I had to prevent the default event while moving the finger on the touchpad, and use jQuery scrollTop to scroll manually. As far as I can see it doesn't lead to undesired side-effects.
